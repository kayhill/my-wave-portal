# Web3 App: Leave a Song, Win some ETH

An Ethereum aplication with a simple smart contract written in Solidity. I used Hardhat for building and testing this app in my local environment, before deploying to the Rinkeby Test Network and connecting with a React-App UI.

User's must connect a MetaMask wallet to use the app. User's submit a song and have a 1 in 4 chance of winning some (test) ETH!

This is a Buildspace project, completed with the Ginan cohort.
